## 📌 Key Findings

- **Office Supplies** was the highest-selling product category across regions.
- **West, East, and Central** were the top-performing regions by sales.
- The **Delivery Truck**, while economical, was frequently used for high-priority orders — this indicates **inefficiencies in logistics**.
- Several **bottom-tier customers** showed potential based on order frequency but lacked volume — suggesting a targeted campaign could improve revenue.
- **Small business customers** drove significant sales but with **lower profit margins** compared to **corporate clients**.
